# Known issues

* \#1 There's no implementation of multi word searches (e. g. _/imageof car bike_) yet, so using multiple words as search string will lead to unwanted behavior. Be sure to use only one word until there's a fix.
* \#2 Sometimes, the bot won't respond when requesting an image.
* \#3 The bot can have quite a long response time. If the bot hasn't sent you a photo after ~15 seconds, simply try again. If still nothing happens, the problem is related to issue \#2.
